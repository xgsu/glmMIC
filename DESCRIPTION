    Inforamtion Criterion (MIC)

Description: This packages computes sparse estimates for generalized linear models (GLM) via
    MIC, a short name for "Minimizing approxiamted Inforatmion Criterion". MIC
    mimics the best subset selection using a penalized likelihood approach yet
    with no need of a tuning parameter. The problem is further reformulated with
    a reparameterization step so that it reduces to an unconstrained nonconvex
    yet smooth programming problem, which can be solved efficiently. The global
    optimization algorithm, Simulated annealing (SA) or its generalized version (GenSA),
    is used for optimization, possibly combined with a local optimization
    algorithm (BFGS). Furthermore, the reparameterization tactic yields an
    additional advantage in terms of circumventing post-selection inference.
